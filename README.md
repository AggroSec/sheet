# SHEET - Security Hacking Enumeration and Exploitation Tool

## Cheatsheet for the Offensive Edge

SHEET (Security Hacking Enumeration and Exploitation Tool) is a pentesting cheatsheet generator built to accelerate reconnaissance and enumeration during CTFs, pentests, or security assessments. It maps ports and services to actionable commands and resources, powered by Hacktricks. Perfect for Nmap scans or quick reference when you need to strike fast.

## Features

* Port Rules: 100 common ports with services, tools, commands, and Hacktricks links.
* Service Rules: 167 unique services with pentesting details.
* Config-Driven: Customize via port_rules.json and service_rules.json.
* Obsidian Bonus: Unofficial plugin to paste and collapse cheatsheets (see Extras).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AggroSec/sheet.git
cd sheet
```
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Use the included config files:
```
port_rules.json
service_rules.json
```

## Usage

* Generate a cheatsheet from an Nmap scan:
```bash
#quickstart
python portsheet.py --format markdown --output filename nmapscan.xml

#options: output into json, sanitize IP addresses, target(future use in pulling specific computers out of a multi-machine scan(currently not in)), name (required in combination with sanitize)
usage: portsheet.py [-h] [--target TARGET] [--format {markdown,json}] [--sanitize] [--output OUTPUT] [--name NAME] nmap_file
```
* Edit port_rules.json or service_rules.json to suit your needs.
* Open sheet in a Markdown viewer (Obsidian recommended!).

## Config Files

* port_rules.json: Maps ports to services and tools. (this is the default the sheet uses first)
* service_rules.json: Details 167 services with Hacktricks links. (if there is a non-standard port with a known service, it then matches to this. In my test case nmap scan there was ftp on 2121 that also needed to match.)

### Example port_rules.json entry:
```json
"21": {
    "service": "ftp",
    "tools": ["ftp", "hydra"],
    "commands": ["ftp {target}", "hydra -l anonymous -P passwords.txt ftp://{target}"],
    "resources": ["https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ftp/index.html"]
}
```
### Example service_rules.json
```json
"ftp": {
    "tools": ["ftp", "hydra"],
    "commands": ["ftp {target}", "hydra -l anonymous -P passwords.txt ftp://{target}"],
    "resources": ["https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ftp/index.html"]
  }
```

## Extras

* Obsidian Plugin: The extras/ folder includes an unofficial plugin to paste your SHEET cheatsheet into Obsidian with all headings collapsed. See the README in that folder for installation and usage details.
    * Disclaimer: This is an unofficial plugin, not endorsed by Obsidian. Review main.js before use—run at your own risk! (Obsidian plugin was completely generated by Grok, hence the warning.)

## Contributing

* Add ports/services to the JSON files and submit a PR.

## To-Do / Wishful Thinking

* Integrate CVE lookups.
* Support more scan types.
* write up of my experience using AI to create a tool
    * what it did good, where I struggled to get it to do something.
