# SHEET Collapse Plugin

Unofficial Obsidian plugin for importing SHEET cheatsheets with collapsed headings

## Installation

* Copy the the contents of this extras folder to .obsidian/plugins/ in your Obsidian vault.
* In Obsidian, go to Settings > Community Plugins and enable “SHEET Collapse.”
* Ensure “Fold headings” is turned on in Settings > Editor.

## Usage

1. Open a note
2. Press Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on Mac) to open the Command Palette (or press the Open Command Palette button on left sidebar) 
3. Type and select “Import SHEET Cheatsheet (Collapsed).”
4. Paste your SHEET Markdown in the modal and click “Import.”
5. Your cheatsheet will append to the note with all headings collapsed.

## Notes

Works best in Source Mode for reliable folding.  
Requires “Fold headings” enabled in Obsidian settings.  
this is not required, and totally lazy.  
there is also an option to just paste the markdown into a note then run the command fold all from the palette as well, this is more of an alternative way of doing it.

This is an unofficial plugin, not endorsed by Obsidian. Review main.js before use—run at your own risk!
